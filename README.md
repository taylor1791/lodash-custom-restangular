# lodash-custom-restangular

[Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) is a great library, however
it is requires [lodash](http://lodash.com) or
[underscore](http://underscorejs.org). These are a great libraries, but some
do not want to use them for some reason.

This package creates a custom build of lodash with all of the required
functionality that restangular requires. 

## Usage 

Simpily run `npm install lodash-custom-restangular`.
